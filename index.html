					<h1>GitFlow Workshop</h1>
					<p>
						Workshop on how to use Git for feature branching and running a project according to the <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitFlow</a> process.
					</p>
				</header>

				<section>
					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p>
						A core concept in Git is the concept of <b>branches</b>. On a personal, small-scale or fairly uncomplicated project you might not have the need to run separate branches. The case then is usually simply to <i>push to master</i>. But what should one do when working on big projects? The <b>GitFlow</b> process is one way of solving this issue.
					</p>

					<img src="img/meme.jpg">

					<p>
						This workshop will focus on training us in the use of the well-established GitFlow model. Successful use of this model will allow us to keep better track of our own changes, and ultimately provide a safer workflow for the collective master branch which will henceforth only receive reviewed code. GitFlow offers some additional structure to the more general so-called <b>feature branch workflow</b>, but all in all they work pretty much the same way. The main difference could be stated that, <u>in the GitFlow process, branches are also used for releases and hotfixes</u> (and potentially other classes of important branches) beyond just the <code>master</code> and <code>develop</code> branches.
					</p>

					<p>
						Remember that Git is essentially just a logging system to determine where, what and in which context changes have taken place. When working on a larger project it makes sense to isolate any work you are doing from the work of others until your work is ready for review and subsequent integration into the overall <code>master</code> branch of the project. The most common way of achieving this isolation is by working in a separate branch of the project.
					</p>

					<p>
						Because Git tracks <i>changes in files</i>, rather than <i>actual</i> files, <u>you don't (usually) need multiple sets of the project files</u>. However, what you need to do is <u>always make sure you work in the correct branch</u>, so changes don't carry over straight into another branch, like the <code>develop</code> or <code>master</code> branches.

					<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
					<p>
						This workshop assumes that the following criteria is met.
					</p>

					<aside>
						<ul>
							<li>You have a working understanding of how Git operates</li>
							<li>You have sufficient practical skills to run basic Git tasks such as add (stage), commit, merge, pull, fetch and push to a remote Git repository</li>
							<li>You have cloned <a href="https://github.com/mikaelvesavuori/ws-gitflow" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this workshop's repository</a> to your computer and have local access to all of its files</li>
							<li>You have set the above repository up to your own remote repository, with either a <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/it/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">command line interface (CLI) with Git access</a>, <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/clone-a-repository-223217891.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bitbucket</a>, <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github</a>, or <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/git/tutorial/clone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visual Studio 2015 (or later) with a Team Services account</a></li>
							<li>You have repointed the origin URL to your own repository with <code>git remote set-url origin [YOUR-URL]</code></li>
						</ul>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Overview of commands</h2>
					<p>
						Much of what is going to happen in this workshop will be familiar to you on some level. Below I've outlined the general CLI commands and steps you will learn in order to proficiently work with branches.
					</p>

					<p>
						If not using a CLI, any kind of Git GUI tool will have interactions corresponding to these commands.
					</p>

					<div class="inform">
						<h3>Don't use $ in your CLI</h3>
						<p>
							Please note that the dollar sign ($) always denotes the command line. Don't copy it into your CLI – use the rest of the text.
						</p>
					</div>

					<aside>
						<ul>
							<li><code class="full">$ git branch [some-branch]</code>Creates a new branch with the specified name</li>
							<li><code class="full">$ git branch -d [some-branch]</code>Deletes the local branch with the specified name</li>
							<li><code class="full">$ git push origin --delete [some-branch]</code>Deletes the remote branch with the specified name</li>
							<li><code class="full">$ git checkout [some-branch]</code>Switches to the branch with the specified name</li>
							<li><code class="full">$ git checkout -b [newbranch] [oldbranch]</code><u>Creates a new branch</u> with the specified name (if it doesn't already exist) <u>from a previous branch</u> and <u>switches to the new branch</u><br>
								<b>Example usage</b>: <code>$ git checkout -b myfeature develop</code></li>
							<li><code class="full">$ git merge [mergefrom]</code>Merge the specified branch onto the current branch<br>
								<b>Example usage</b>: <code>$ git merge develop</code>, meaning that the <code>develop</code> branch will be added on top of your current branch</li>
						</ul>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Structure of branches</h2>
					<p>
						The following is how we will use branching in this workshop, which also corresponds to the overall GitFlow workflow.
					</p>

					<aside>
						<ul>
							<li><b>master</b>: This should always be a stable branch with write access only by someone who has review responsibilities</li>
							<li><b>develop</b>: This should be the <u>default ("unstable") working branch</u></li>
							<li><b>feature</b>: Any additional features or individual work should be separated into their own branches (use a descriptive name, such as "animated-menu-items") so that all work is easily overviewed and isolated; <u>feature branches should be branched out from <code>develop</code></u></li>
							<li><b>hotfix</b>: Any urgent fixes that need to be stable should always be branched out from <code>master</code></li>
							<li><b>release</b>: All stable public releases go into their own separate release versions (for example according to <a href="http://semver.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">semver</a>, such as 0.1 or 1.0 or 2.4.1) essentially working <u>only as an archive</u> after they've been publicly released</li>
						</ul>

					<h2><span>1.</span> Add the develop branch</h2>
					<p>
						The very first thing we want to do is make sure we have a <code>develop</code> branch available so our code doesn't mess with the code that is currently deployed on <code>master</code>.
					</p>

					<h3 class="accordion">CLI</h3>
					<div class="accordion--content">
						<p>
							You can list the current branches in the project with <code>$ git branch</code>. It won't say much right now, so let's create the <code>develop</code> branch.
						</p>

						<p>
							Enter <code>$ git branch develop</code> and run <code>$ git branch</code> again. You will now see two branches and that <code>master</code> is highlighted.
						</p>

						<p>
							Try switching to the <code>develop</code> branch by entering <code>$ git checkout develop</code> and then <code>$ git branch</code>. Finally, return to the <code>master</code> so we can sync this with the remote.
						</p>

						<div class="inform">
							<h3>Starting with the remote branch first?</h3>
							<p>
								Using the GitHub web interface means that we can only directly affect the remote repository with the changes we do in the web GUI.
							</p>

							<p>
								You can choose to follow along with the following example, which for steps 1 and 2 will be in <u>reverse-order to the intended workshop order</u>. It works just as well, but is likely a much less common pattern than creating the local branch first.
							</p>
						</div>

						<p>
							On the repo's front page you will find the branch selector. Here you will find all of the branches in the project. Click the selector button and type in a new branch name, and then hit the "Create branch" button.
						</p>

						<img src="img/github_createbranch.png">

						<p>
							We need to synchronize the branch that now only exists on the remote with our computer. Do this by running (in the CLI) <code>$ git pull</code> to retrieve the new branch, followed by <code>$ git checkout develop</code> to step into the branch and make sure it is being tracked. End by running <code>$ git checkout master</code> to return.

						Make sure you are on the <code>facelift</code> branch.

					<p>
						Open up readme.md in a text editor or IDE, and find the section called "Initial text". Copy the entire block of text and paste it above the previous "Initial text" block.
					</p>

					<p>
						Replace "Initial text" with "Feature" or something similar. Add three hash characters (#) before the "I" (signalling that this is a third-level heading in the Markdown language). Make sure there is a space between the third hash and the "I". Also, insert a line break between the two paragraphs so the text doesn't look so cramped.
					</p>

					<img src="img/text_feature.png">

					<p>
						If you run <code>$ git status</code> (or whatever similar functionality you have in your GUI), you should see that some changes have been made. Add the file, commit, and then push the changes to the remote's <code>facelift</code> branch. The edit will now only be seen in readme.md on the <code>facelift</code> branch and not in any of the others.

						The <b>pull request</b> is used as a way to communicate to your team that changes have taken place and that you wish these to be reviewed and integrated into the main branch (<code>develop</code> or <code>master</code>). A pull request should therefore always contain a pertinent, meaningful description so others know what you've done.
					</p>

						The changes we made and pushed to our own <code>facelift</code> branch are now uploaded, but unfortunately also contained and not integrated. What a shame that our nice styling is not available for others to see! &#x2639; Let's fix this.

					<h2><span>1.</span> Add a new hotfix branch</h2>
					<p>
						Oftentimes, you will have to create a hotfix which may come as an abrupt surprise to your workday. Fear not! By creating a hotfix branch, we will attempt to quickly fix whatever is broken and base it entirely on stable <code>master</code> branch code.
					</p>

					<p>
						In this case, someone made a <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/derp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">derp</a> and totally missed that the dude in The Metamorphosis is Czech and not Swedish. Doh! <u>Let's change Johan Andersson to Gregor Samsa</u> to redeem ourselves for this error. What's more is that <u>he shouldn't be a spider, he's a bug</u>! Oh - and we need to take care of this right away so no "oh, I'll do this thing here first" or "just one more game of Candy Crush plz :(".
					</p>

					<h3>All</h3>
					<p>
						First, we need to create a branch. We'll call it <code>hotfix-name</code> so we give at least some semantic context for what our fix is about. This procedure is identical to what we did in <a href="#task2">Task 2</a>. This time, however, you want to derive from the <code>master</code> branch, so the CLI command would be <code>$ git checkout -b hotfix-name master</code>.
					</p>

					<p>
						When it's been created, make sure you are on the <code>hotfix-name</code> branch.
					</p>

					<p>
						Open up readme.md in a text editor or IDE. Because nothing new has happened to our readme.md file (and nothing's been pushed/pulled), we won't see the styling changes we made previously – they are contained only in <code>develop</code>. That's entirely OK! We just want to fix the name problem so readers will be happy as soon as possible.
					</p>

					<p>
						Just like last time, copy the text block with the heading "Initial text" and paste it over the first one, so we have two copies. Change the new, uppermost block's heading to "Hotfix" or something similar so we can distinguish between these later.

						If you run <code>$ git status</code> (or whatever similar functionality you have in your GUI), you should see that some changes have been made. Add, commit and push the changes to our remote's <code>hotfix-name</code> branch. The edit will now only be seen in readme.md on the <code>hotfix-name</code> branch and not in any of the others.
					</p>

					<p>
						Finally, we again need to make a pull request, get it accepted and merged into <code>master</code>, and then delete local and remote versions of the <code>hotfix-name</code> branch.

					<p>
						Now for our final task. We want to create a dedicated release version containing all of the work we've done thus far. The branch, which we will call <code>release-1.0</code>, will serve as our real, foundational public version. Step one is to push <code>develop</code>, which now contains the hotfixes and the styling feature update, into <code>master</code>, forming a new stable version. Finally, the new <code>master</code> will be used as the starting point for <code>release-1.0</code>. While <code>master</code> will receive updates as long as our project lives, these specific release versions will never be updated again.

							You should receive a merge conflict when trying to merge <code>develop</code> into <code>master</code> because of the two different edits to readme.md. Solve the conflict by accepting both changes either with a diff checker or manually by removing the merge tags.
