# ws-gitflow
Workshop on how to use Git for feature branching and running a project according to the [GitFlow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) process.

## What we will make
Because Git works so well with text/code and we don't want any unnecessary complexity, we will use this readme.md as our base work document to learn the secrets of feature branching and GitFlow! In our workshop we will correct the below text into forming the two first paragraphs from Franz Kafka's [The Metamorphosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Metamorphosis), originally published in 1915.

This way it will be really easy for you to see the changes you've made, since readme.md is usually displayed front-and-center in a Git repository regardless of the exact GUI you are using.

## What we will use
Instructions are provided for the following common software setups. The procedure itself should be exactly the same regardless of your chosen setup.

- **CLI**: A purely command-line based approach, using a remote repo on whatever service on want; note that CLI-only won't be able to do pull requests
- **Github + CLI**: A combination of using a CLI and doing a number of tasks (such as pull requests) through the GitHub web interface
- **Bitbucket + Sourcetree**: Using Bitbucket as the Git service, and Sourcetree as a GUI
- **Visual Studio 2015**: Entirely GUI-driven procedure; note that you require a Team Services account to fully use the web interface

## How we will use branching in this workshop
The below branches will be created and used during the course of the workshop.

- **master**: We will only have stable code in this branch
- **develop**: This is the primary branch in which we will develop and deploy our code
- **feature**: Add small heading for chapter and separate paragraphs with line break
- **hotfix**: Correct name and correct creature type
- **release**: Final version with both the styling changes and the correct name

## Workshop instructions
The workshop material is contained in index.html – just follow along with the instructions there. Again, make all your changes in readme.md (this document!).

## How do I get started?
Clone this repository to your computer and set it up with your [CLI](https://git-scm.com/book/it/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository), [Bitbucket](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/clone-a-repository-223217891.html) together with [Sourcetree](https://confluence.atlassian.com/get-started-with-sourcetree/clone-a-remote-repository-847359098.html), [Github](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) or [Visual Studio 2015 (or later) with a Team Services account](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/git/gitquickstart). Then just open index.html in a web browser and follow along!

## Initial text
I
One morning, as Johan Andersson was waking up from anxious dreams, he discovered that in bed he had been changed into a monstrous verminous spider. He lay on his armour-hard back and saw, as he lifted his head up a little, his brown, arched abdomen divided up into rigid bow-like sections. From this height the blanket, just about ready to slide off completely, could hardly stay in place. His numerous legs, pitifully thin in comparison to the rest of his circumference, flickered helplessly before his eyes.
‘What’s happened to me,’ he thought. It was no dream. His room, a proper room for a human being, only somewhat too small, lay quietly between the four well-known walls. Above the table, on which an unpacked collection of sample cloth goods was spread out (Andersson was a traveling salesman) hung the picture which he had cut out of an illustrated magazine a little while ago and set in a pretty gilt frame. It was a picture of a woman with a fur hat and a fur boa. She sat erect there, lifting up in the direction of the viewer a solid fur muff into which her entire forearm disappeared.
